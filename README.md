## 📈 Key Findings

- **Top Products:**  
  Printers and Bookcases were the most purchased items, consistently exceeding the 5,000 sales mark. This suggests strong demand for stationery-related products.  
  *Recommendation:* Focus on stocking and promoting these products to increase profitability.

- **Payment Methods:**  
  Cash on Delivery (COD) was the predominant payment method.  
  *Recommendation:* Introduce targeted discounts or cashback offers for UPI payments to encourage digital adoption.
